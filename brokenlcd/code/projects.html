<h2>surfraw</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org">homepage</a></li>
<li>i've written several elvi:
<ol>
<li>duckduckgo - i rewrote ianb's version of the duckduckgo elvi to
include multiple improvements: defaulting to ssl search, javascript
toggle, and control over other parameters; also includes improvements
when used in text mode. confirmed for 2.2.8.</li>
<li>openports - there is an openbsd elvi that includes a rudimentary
<a href="http://www.openports.se">openports.se</a> search; i wrote a dedicated
openports elvi that allows for searching based on every parameter allowed
by the site. confirmed for 2.2.8.</li>
<li>cablesearch - this is an unprecedented elvi (in that its functionality 
isn't based or included at all in any other elvi) that searches for leaked
diplomatic cables. ianb noted that as julian assange was the original
author of surfraw, this was only appropriate. i wrote this on behalf of
msowers, who asked me to include it while i was adding the other two elvi.
confirmed for 2.2.8. ianb also kept my "mischievous comment" in the local
options. i guess i should take credit / blame for any panicky emails...</li>
<li>stackoverflow - searches stack overflow, includes options to search by
tags and ask a question, among other options. this has not been confirmed
for inclusion in any version yet.</li>
</ol>

<h2>pymusiclib</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kisom/pymusiclib">github page</a></li>
<li>python tools to handle music libraries. currently supported are:
  <em> dedup.py - handles tag-based (and optionally hash-based, defaulting
  to the python-crypto md5 module)
  </em> AudioFile - python class that includes a generic audio file metadata
  class supporting easier comparison between types of audio. including
  a magic file function to automatically handle a given file. currently
  supports mp3 and aac (mp4) audio files; flac support shouldn't be 
  too hard to add later on. also includes a number of tools to assist
  in comparing two audio files, including a select option that, given
  two AudioFile instances, returns the filename of the file that should
  be removed (but can be easily adapted to return the higher quality
  of the two).</li>
<li>in progress:
  * orglib.py - tag-based music library organisation. currently a blank
  file in the repository, mostly to remind me to actually do something
  with it.</li>
</ul>

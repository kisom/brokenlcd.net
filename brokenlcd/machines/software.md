_weapons of mass development_
-----------------------------

most of the tools i use are console-based, as it is much easier for me
to pull up a new terminal and invoke behaviour through an explicit 
commandline than to sit around waiting for a gui to load. i use these on a 
regular basis:

* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) - this alone has increased my
ability to get things done exponentially. bsd-licensed and it doesn't 
suck like screen.
* [cmus](http://cmus.sourceforge.net) - console music player with a
[scrobbler](https://github.com/freshprince/cmuscrobbler).
* [vim](http://vim.org) - the text editor bestowed upon mankind by raptor
jesus himself.
* [nvi](http://www.kotnet.org/~skimo/nvi) - the new vi, i use this for
editing gnu makefiles so i don't have to screw up my tabstops in vim.
* [surfraw](http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org) - shell user's revolutionary
front rage against the web. fast cli to the www. 
* [mutt](http://www.mutt.org) - text-based email client.
* [lynx](http://lynx.isc.org) - minimal text www browser. excellent for
browsing documentation, looking up information, and realizing how badly
written most webpages are.
* [links](http://links.sourceforge.net) - minimal text www browser 
supporting frames. links2 even has a graphical mode and supports javascript,
if that's your thing.
* [xxxterm](https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/XXXTerm) - a lightweight
(except for webkit) browser with vim keybindings. i was hooked as soon as 
i gave it a shot.    
* [scrotwm](https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/scrotwm) - a tiling window
manager that i started using in 2011. it has the tiling i've come to love from
awesome but is more lightweight and supports a more easily-customised 
statusbar.     
* [fluxbox](http://www.fluxbox.org) -  i used fluxbox as my window manager for 
close to eight years before i found awesome. dead simple configuration (but 
highly customisable) through _flat_ files, not xml-crap.    
* [awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org) - i switched from fluxbox to awesome
in mid-2010. the lua scripting is pretty cool, and tiling windows managers
are great.    
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) - i spend far too much time in zsh.     
* [irssi](http://www.irssi.org) - there are other irc clients out there?
(although i have been thinking about giving 
[ii](http://tools.suckless.org/ii/) a shot.) irssi has plugins supporting
silc and otr, however. combined with [bitlbee](http://www.bitlbee.org),
it is extremely useful to me. 
* [snownews](http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/) - rss reader of 
choice, perfect for keeping up on [undeadly](http://www.undeadly.org) and
[hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com).
* [abook](http://abook.sourceforge.net) - address book application.
* [calcurse](http://culot.org/calcurse) - curses-based task lists, events,
and calender.
* [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net) - a lightweight system monitor.   


_operating systems_
-------------------

i "grew up" on netbsd, my first unix, via the 
[super dimension fortress](http://www.sdf.org). later on i moved to a
couple of linux distros on my personal machines, mostly what i could find
in the backs of a few library books or discount linux books from the local
storefront of a certain national computer store chain. these included 
redhat, mandrake (before it was mandrivia), before going back to netbsd
on a thinkpad t20 in 2005. 

the operating systems i prefer:
* **[openbsd](http://www.openbsd.org)** - definitely the favourite. 
well-coded, thoroughly audited, done right. this is currently running as my
primary 'get-shit-done' operating system.
* **[debian](http://www.debian.org)** - _ahem_... i don't always use linux, but when i do, i use debian.
* **[haiku](http://www.haiku-os.org)** - it's not beos but it looks and 
feels a lot like it. it is still quite rough around the edges, so it's not
suitable for use a primary desktop.
* **os x** - not free, but unix under the hood and just works. i use this as 
my spare laptop, set up for development work and doing ios dev, and used for
multimedia and browsing.

why i don't like the gpl
------------------------

the gpl is a fairly popular open source license, and in all honesty it did well
for bringing open source code and code freedom into the world. this won't be
one of those expositories on the obnoxious character of rms, or a 
holier-than-thou soliloquy, but rather conveying my argument that we can do 
better than the gpl, at least for those interested in *actual* freedom.

the gpl is one of those pesky "copyleft" licenses that is viral in nature. it
forbids changing the license, and any derivative works are required to be 
licensed under the same license. this imposes a restriction on the software,
and therefore the code is not truly free. for my personal code, i release under
a dual license: users have the choice of public domain or the isc license,
choosing whichever affords more freedoms. unfortunately, even the isc is 
encumbered with a mark of virility:

   Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any
   purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above 
   copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.

this is why i release under a dual license. i would rather users have the 
freedom to do *whatever* with my code. if someone can take it and incorporate it
into a great commercial product, that is a good thing because the software is
being used actively.

why hack: inside the mind of a coder
------------------------------------

i get asked a lot why it is i spend so much time writing code or tinkering
on the computer. the short answer is because i can't not code. it's just
something i have to do.

the long answer has to do with some of the abstract ideas behind what the
computer represents. at its heart, a computer is nothing more than a 
boolean haze, an enormously complex state machine. to the processor, a
thought or a concept is nothing more than a series of (usually) contigous
on/off cells presented in a context meaningful to the end user. yet we 
harness this haze, bringing order to a sea of ones and zeroes, and somehow
take meaning, utility, beauty, and poetry out of it.

on the face of it, the binary haze is contained entirely inside a contraption
formed of plastics, metals, and processed sand; we connect them together with
strands of metal or stretched-out glass sheathed in a protective coating of
plastic, rubber, or sometimes even kevlar. we lay these strands across our
rooms, homes, cities, countries, and even across the oceans - spanning 
thousands of miles and buried thousands of feet below the oceans' surface.
somehow these allow us to communicate in real time with each other. a father
can talk to his children from the other side of the world, and long-lost
relatives converse as if in the same room. with the advent of videoconferencing
and video chats, the complex nuances of body language and facial expressions
is retained. 


in short, it is that repeated 'somehow' that has captured my fancy. the somehow
turns out to be well-defined
and that is what i believe all of programming boils down to: structuring 
data into a meaningful context; applying a specific perspective to the
boolean haze to extract something meaningful.

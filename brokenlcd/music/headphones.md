----------------

large studio headphones are staples of my late night coding sessions.
right now, i'm using two sets of headphones:

* the pair i keep in my backpack and take to work are my 
[steelseries](http://www.steelseries.com) 
[siberia](http://steelseries.com/us/products/audio/steelseries-siberia-v2)
headphones. the sound quality is decent, but i would not have paid the 
$100 original price tag (i picked them up for $35 recertified on newegg).
i have gotten comments twice for having these at work because they are
very white and pretty big. they have acceptable bass (not terrific but
tolerable for $35), are moderately comfortable (do kind of get annoying
after a while), but do have a long cable and an inline volume control, which
I rather like. they came with a microphone but i don't use the mic ever.

* the pair i use for serious work are a set of 
[beyerdynamic](http://www.beyerdynamic.com) 
[dt770 pro](http://www.beyerdynamic.com/shop/dt-770-pro.html) studio 
headphones. excellent base, extremely comfortable, and very good at blocking
out a lot of ambient noise. 

* i also use a [FiiO E5](http://www.fiio.com.cn/product/index.aspx?ID=6&MenuID=020301)
portable headphone amplifier at work, which does an excellent job of
providing better sound at lower levels and helping me drown out coworkers
who talk quite loudly by my cubicle.

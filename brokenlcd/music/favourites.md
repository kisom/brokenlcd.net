favourite albums
================

inspired by the section on the uplink developer's cd, which was an 
my first real look at basement programmers doing something useful.
these are albums i really never get tired of.

_uplink soundtrack_
-------------------
one of my favourite time-wasters in high school. i love the visual design
of the game, and the soundtrack was perfect for the game. the only problem
i have with it is that even with the three bonus tracks, it's far too short.
at one point i remember not liking _deep in her eyes_ but it is now one of
my favourites, and blue valley still evokes strong memories of late nights
coding perl.

_faithless - outrospective_
---------------------------
probably one of the first pirated cds i ever got, hanh gave this to me in
high school. i don't think there is a track i **don't** love on this cd,
but in particular, crazy english summer, mohammed ali, not enuf love, donny
x, one step too far, and evergreen are favourites. i spent a lot of time
on consoles listening to this album.

_massive attack - protection / mezzanine_
-----------------------------------------
i don't know which of these i can call better, both remind me strongly of
late nights lost in the green and black, reading zines and chilling in irc.
one of my early machines was a 486 running freedos, and i spent a lot of
time in x86 assembly listening to these two albums.

_radiohead - ok computer_
